****FPGA INTRO

This repo contains information you'll find useful for getting Quartus set up, and your first project up and running.

Start to setup a project yourself following the quick-start guide. Note that the pinmap file link is down. Use the one in this repository instead. Also, if you are not prompted to select a driver when you plug in your FPGA, go to "Devices and Printers" and manually select the driver path, which is "C:\altera\13.0sp1\quartus\drivers\usb-blaster" under default installation settings.

If something doesn't work, try opening and compiling the example project in example_project. If that works, then you've likely configured something wrong.

If you run into any problems, ask google. Then ask me.

Enjoy
